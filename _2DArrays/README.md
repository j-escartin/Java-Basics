### Context:

Given a  6 x 6  2D Array, A :
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

We define an hourglass in A  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:
a b c
  d
e f g

There are 16  hourglasses in A , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

### Task:
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.
