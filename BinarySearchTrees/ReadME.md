# Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of data structure that is used to store and retrieve data efficiently. It is a tree structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child.

The key property of a BST is that the value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the value of the node, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than or equal to the value of the node. This property makes searching and insertion of elements in the tree efficient, as the tree can be traversed in a sorted order.

The binary search tree is a useful data structure for implementing many algorithms, such as searching, sorting, and indexing. It is commonly used in computer science for a variety of tasks, including database management, file systems, and data compression.

### Task
The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. You are given a pointer, root , pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.

### Input Format

The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a binary search tree:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the n subsequent lines contains an integer, data, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

### Output Format

The locked stub code in your editor will print the integer returned by your getHeight function denoting the height of the BST.
