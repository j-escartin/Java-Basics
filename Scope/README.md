### Context:

The absolute difference between two integers, a and  b, is written as |a-b| . The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements , is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in _elements.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing  N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

### Task

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the _elements instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any  2 numbers in _elements  and stores it in the maximum Difference  instance variable.

### Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in the editor reads in 2 lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the elements array. The second line has N space-separated integers that describe the _elements array.

### Output Format

You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the maximDifference  instance variable.
