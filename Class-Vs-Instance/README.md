### Problem

Write a Person class with an instance variable, age , and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge , as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to  after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge , the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
- If age < 13, print You are young..

- Otherwise, print You are old..
